This program has been created by me to help me, and others to conceptualise how tokenising works (with a pinch of arrays). 
Tokenising is basically taking in input values and seperating them with something called a delimiter (e.g. ","). I have been taught in my lectures that it's utilized greatly in applications such as excel in .csv files, when dealing with massive data sets.
In university, in my first year, I had lacked a substantial amount of logic when it came to this particular topic. I skimmed my way through it.
Hence, I have created this program. This program allows you to take in the two data types (either a string or a integer) and tokenise it and store it in an array. Then print out the values.
Use this code to see the backend of how I'm storing it and printing it.
